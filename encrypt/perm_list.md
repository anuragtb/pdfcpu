# List Permissions

The PDF specification defines a set of permissions that may be set for encrypted documents.
This command prints the current permission set. Have a look at some [examples](#examples).

## Usage

```
pdfcpu perm list [-v(erbose)|vv] [-upw userpw] [-opw ownerpw] inFile
```

### Flags

| name                             | description     | required
|:---------------------------------|:----------------|:--------

| [vv](../getting_started.md)      | verbose logging | no
| [upw](../getting_started.md)     | user password   | no
| [opw](../getting_started.md)     | owner password  | no

## Examples

`pdfcpu` does not require any password for listing the permissions of an encrypted document unless the *user password* is set:

```
pdfcpu encrypt -opw opw enc.pdf
writing enc.pdf ...

pdfcpu perm list enc.pdf
permission bits:            0
Bit  3: false (print(rev2), print quality(rev>=3))
Bit  4: false (modify other than controlled by bits 6,9,11)
Bit  5: false (extract(rev2), extract other than controlled by bit 10(rev>=3))
Bit  6: false (add or modify annotations)
Bit  9: false (fill in form fields(rev>=3)
Bit 10: false (extract(rev>=3))
Bit 11: false (modify(rev>=3))
Bit 12: false (print high-level(rev>=3))
```

<br>

If both passwords are set, you need to provide either one to list permissions:

```
pdfcpu encrypt -opw opw -upw upw enc.pdf
writing enc.pdf ...

pdfcpu perm list enc.pdf
Please provide the correct password

pdfcpu perm list -upw upw enc.pdf
permission bits:            0
Bit  3: false (print(rev2), print quality(rev>=3))
Bit  4: false (modify other than controlled by bits 6,9,11)
Bit  5: false (extract(rev2), extract other than controlled by bit 10(rev>=3))
Bit  6: false (add or modify annotations)
Bit  9: false (fill in form fields(rev>=3)
Bit 10: false (extract(rev>=3))
Bit 11: false (modify(rev>=3))
Bit 12: false (print high-level(rev>=3))

pdfcpu perm list -opw opw enc.pdf
permission bits:            0
Bit  3: false (print(rev2), print quality(rev>=3))
Bit  4: false (modify other than controlled by bits 6,9,11)
Bit  5: false (extract(rev2), extract other than controlled by bit 10(rev>=3))
Bit  6: false (add or modify annotations)
Bit  9: false (fill in form fields(rev>=3)
Bit 10: false (extract(rev>=3))
Bit 11: false (modify(rev>=3))
Bit 12: false (print high-level(rev>=3))
```

If only the *user password* is set then that's also what you need to provide:

```
pdfcpu encrypt -upw upw enc.pdf
writing enc.pdf ...

pdfcpu perm list enc.pdf
Please provide the correct password

pdfcpu perm list -upw upw enc.pdf
permission bits:            0
Bit  3: false (print(rev2), print quality(rev>=3))
Bit  4: false (modify other than controlled by bits 6,9,11)
Bit  5: false (extract(rev2), extract other than controlled by bit 10(rev>=3))
Bit  6: false (add or modify annotations)
Bit  9: false (fill in form fields(rev>=3)
Bit 10: false (extract(rev>=3))
Bit 11: false (modify(rev>=3))
Bit 12: false (print high-level(rev>=3))
```
