## Usage

```

```

## Examples

Decrypt and remove password protection from `test.pdf` using the provided user password:
```sh
pdfcpu decrypt -upw upw test.pdf
writing test.pdf ...
```
<br>

Decrypt and remove password protection from `test_enc.pdf` using the provided user password and write the output file to `test.pdf`:
```sh
pdfcpu decrypt -upw upw test_enc .pdf test.pdf
writing test.pdf ...
```

<br>

Even for files protected by both passwords for decryption all you need to know  is the *user password*:

```sh
pdfcpu encrypt -opw opw -upw upw test.pdf
writing test.pdf ...

pdfcpu decrypt test.pdf
Please provide the correct password

pdfcpu decrypt -opw opw test.pdf
writing test.pdf ...
```

<br>

In fact for decryption you don't need to know the *owner password* of an encrypted file that is not protected from unauthorized opening with a *user password* :
```sh
pdfcpu encrypt -opw opw test.pdf
writing test.pdf ...

pdfcpu decrypt test.pdf 
writing test.pdf ...
```
