### Arguments

| name         | description            | required
|:-------------|:-----------------------|:--------

| upwNew       | new user password      | yes

## Examples

You can set the *user password* either when you `encrypt` a file or later with `changeupw`.

Change the *user password* of a document that already has one:
```sh
pdfcpu encrypt -upw upw enc.pdf
writing enc.pdf ...

pdfcpu changeupw enc.pdf upw upwNew
writing enc.pdf ...
```

<br>

Set the *user password* of a document that has none. Any encrypted PDF file has either one of the two passwords set. Whenever you change the *user password* of a document that has a *owner password* set, you have to provide the current *owner password*:

```sh
pdfcpu encrypt -opw opw enc.pdf
writing enc.pdf ...

pdfcpu changeupw enc.pdf "" upwNew
Please provide the owner password with -opw

pdfcpu changeupw -opw opw enc.pdf "" upwNew
writing enc.pdf ...
```
